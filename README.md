This is an Atlas Game built on C++ language. It is a single player versus computer game with basic 'atlas' rules. The game is designed using the graphics library (or header file) of cpp for great user experience. The names of the countries are read from a text file and stored in an array based multi-linked list. This provides efficient retrieval of data as and when required.
